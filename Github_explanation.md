``An explanation of Git &amp; GitHub in my POV.``

**Git** is just a tool used to keep track of changes in code over time, collaborating and sharing. 

**GitHub** is just a website or software of _Git_ with a more readable user-interface.

_**What is a Respository?**_ for me i would say a respository is a piece memory or space used to store data( <sup>Project files</sup> ), a history of changes are documented and kept. 

<font color="red"> Cloning </font>
- This is a duplication of a file with an intension of making it local, so that it can be used easily e.g in a code 
editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Branches and forks
- while both of these terms seem to mean the ~~same~~, they are different. 
#### Branches
- Branches like the name suggests, its when a group of people( _Colleagues or friends_ ) work together on a certain project but divide the work in smaller pieces to make progress. once all are done its merged together. 
#### Forking
- This is mostly done as individuals, because before you make changes in someones project our ideas or work will be previewed and be tested before being merged witb the original. 
### Committing and pushing
- This refers to the process of updating a certain project after making some changes or after adding new information that might help the project. 

**Issues and profile** These two are Self-explanatory. 

**Markdown**
- is the [CSS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) of github, in other words it is the one which helps in terms of styling and formatting of documents in github. in summary it is used in :
1. Formatting paragraphs. 

2. Styling of texts and fonts. 

3. Adding links, colours, pictures, etc. 

 ***GitHub a social platform***
* GitHub also has similar features of a social media( e.g *Facebook*, *Instagram, etc*) because you can like someone's project, this is called starring. you can create a profile and follow your colleagues too. 

## Challenges encountered 
- Some of the *markdown* features where ~~not~~ working for me. (Sorry everything works just fine, after re-reading the docs again am getting the hang of it :smile:). 
- Am finding it hard to understand what *pull request* means or maybe i just confused it with *forking*
- just need to go through it once more maybe also watch some videos on YouTube then i will understand it fully.
- Otherwise GitHub is a very important tool for very developer out there ðŸ™‚. 

<!-- Am ready for the critics XD -->

THANK YOU FOR READING ðŸ“–.
